This folder contains the descriptors and scripts files used to test the 5G-TRANSFORMER Use Cases, and it is structured as follows:


descriptors:
    <use case>
        vsb_<vsb name>.json: Vertical Service Blueprint file to be used with the GUI (i.e. it only contains the vsb parameters)
        vsb_<vsb name>_full.json: Vertical Service Blueprint file to be used with NBI (it contains the translation rules, the NSD, vnfds, and translation rules)
        vsd_<vsb name>_template.json: Vertical Service Descriptor template which is used by the scripts to generate the final VSD with the obtained blueprint id
        vsd_<vsb name>.json: Vertical Service Descriptor file generated from the previous file

scripts:
     <use case>
        properties.sh: file containing the environment variables used by the functions in slicer_functions.sh for this use case (vsbs to onboard, tenant, group)

     slicer_functions.sh: defines the bash functions to interact with the 5GT-VS NBI
