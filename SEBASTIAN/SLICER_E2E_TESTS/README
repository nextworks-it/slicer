In order to run the E2E tests for the slicer, you have to perform the following steps:

1. The configuration on both VSMF_APP and NSMF_APP are in the application.properties_VSMF_APP and  application.properties_NSMF_APP, respectively.

2. Run an instance of VSMF_APP
3. Run an instance of NSMF_APP
4. Make sure that on the NFVO Catalogue there is NOT any NSD.

5. Set on the test source code the IP address of VSMF_APP and NSMF_APP

6. You can easily run the test with mvn run command.


It performs the following operations:
1. On NSP side
  1.1 is performed the login as admin to create a group a new tenant (called tenantNSP) is created in
  1.2 perform the login with the just created tenant

The above info are in the related JSON file. Please check the source code for further details.


2. On DSP side:
Perform the login as admin to:
  2.1 create a group a new tenant (called tenantUN) is created in and the SLA
  2.2 perform the login with the just created tenant

The above info are in the related JSON file. Please check the source code for further details.

2.4 It create the remote tenant info, those related to the tenant created at the step 1.1, and associated it with the local tenant created at step 2.1.


3. On NSP side:
3.1 An association between tenant on DSP created at step 2.3 and local tenant created at step 1.1 is made.
3.2 An NST is on boarded.

##
Briefly there are two associations between tenant and remote tenant:
 On DSP side the tenantUN is associated to tenantNSP on NSP side.
 On NSP side the tenantNSP is associated to tenantNot on DSP side.
##

4. On DSP SIDE, the on boarding of VSB and then of related VSD is performed and tested.
5. The VSI instantiation is tested.
6. The VSI termination is tested.
7. The VSI purge is tested.
