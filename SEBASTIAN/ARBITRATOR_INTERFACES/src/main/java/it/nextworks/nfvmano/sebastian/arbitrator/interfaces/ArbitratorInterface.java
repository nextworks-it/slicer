/**
 * This is the interface of the Vertical Slicer Arbitrator component.
 * The arbitrator takes decisions about how to map new VS instances,
 * described through their NSD, DF, IL, to network slices, based on
 * the SLAs established for the tenant requesting the VS instance and
 * the current resources utilized by the tenant itself.
 * In particular, the arbitrator decides the following:
 * 1. if the request for the new VS instance can be satisfied, based on
 * the SLA
 * 2. if the new VS instance must be mapped on new network slices or
 * existing ones (at the moment only new network slices are supported)
 * 2.a. in case of re-usage of existing slices, if and how they need to be
 * modified (future feature)
 * 3. if existing VS instances needs to be scaled down (future feature)
