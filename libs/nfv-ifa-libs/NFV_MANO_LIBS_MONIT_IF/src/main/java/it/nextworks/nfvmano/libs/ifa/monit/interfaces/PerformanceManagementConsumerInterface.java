/**
 * This interface allows providing of performance information 
 * (measurement results collection and notifications) related to
 * NFV entities.
 * 
 * Collection and reporting of performance information is controlled 
 * by a PM job that groups details of performance collection and reporting information.
 * 
 * Performance information on a given NS results from either collected performance 
 * information of the virtualised resources impacting the connectivity of this NS 
 * instance or VNF performance information, resulting from virtualised resource 
 * performance information, issued by the VNFM for the VNFs that is part of this NS instance.
 * 
 * When new performance information is available, the consumer is notified using 
 * the notification PerformanceInformationAvailableNotification. 
 * 
 * The details of the performance measurements are provided using the PerformanceReport 
 * information element.
 * 
 * The following operations are defined for this interface: 
 * â€¢ Notify operations.
 * 
 * REF IFA 013 v2.3.1 - 7.5 --> This if implements the consumer side and it
 * must be implemented by the plugins that manage the NFVO external interface 
 * and invoked by the NFVO monitoring service
 * 
 * REF IFA 007 v2.3.1 - 7.4.5 --> This if implements the consumer side and it
 * must be implemented by the NFVO and invoked by the VNFM
 * 
 * REF IFA 005 v2.3.1 - 7.7 --> This if implements the consumer side and it
 * must be implemented by the NFVO and invoked by a VIM plugin
